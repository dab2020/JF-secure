<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



There are many great reverse-proxy tools available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs and was easy for users, so I decieded to take open source software like Caddy web-server and NSSM to create a easy tool stack that will reverse-proxy Jellyfin for you. I want to create a an automated stack that does that for you. Right now its just some files thrown into a installer and some commands loaded into it, but I hope that I can make it into a full tool that is super easy to use.

### Built With

* Bat Files
* NSSM
* Caddy webserver
* Python
* NSIS



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.
Clone the repo and experiment by changing the script and .bat files.

### Prerequisites
* A DDNS or custom domain
* Port 80 & 443 forwarded to the machine
* Exemption in firewall for port 80 & 443
* Remote access allowed in Jellyfin

### Installation
## Note
It was brought to my attention that you may require Visual Studio redistributables, that can be downloaded from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170">Microsoft's Offical Site </a>

4. Then press a
5. Input the domain as well as the Jellyfin Server address when prompted
6. You are all good to go
