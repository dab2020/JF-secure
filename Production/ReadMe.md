<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



There are many great reverse-proxy tools available on GitHub, however, I didn't find one that really suit my needs and was user friendly for beginner users, so I decided to take open source software like [Caddy Web-server](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy) and [NSSM](https://github.com/kirillkovalenko/nssm) to create a easy tool stack that will reverse-proxy Jellyfin for you. I wanted it to be automated and be easy to use, even for novice users.

### Built With

* Visual Basic .NET Framework
* [NSIS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/)
* [NSSM](https://github.com/kirillkovalenko/nssm)
* [Caddy Webserver](https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.
Clone the repo and make changes by editing the code primarily the JF-Secure.vb. A Visual Studio Solution is provided for easy setup.

### Prerequisites
* A Custom Domain (ideally using Dynamic DNS)
* Port 80 & 443 forwarded to the Server
* Exemption in the firewall for port 80 & 443
* Remote access allowed in Jellyfin

### Installation
## Note
<b>A remnant of the python script days, Though this is not required, it is good practice </b>
It was brought to my attention in issue #2 that you may require Visual Studio redistributables, that can be downloaded from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170">Microsoft's Official Site </a>
1. Download the latest release
2. Run the installer
3. Click the shortcut on the desktop
4. Click yes, when it askes if this is your first time running the program
5. The Program will ask some questions i.e. domain and address of the Jellyfin Server.
6. The Program will perform some background Tasks and then You are all set to go.
7. The service automatically starts in the background upon system start.


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

1. To reverse-proxy Jellyfin
2. To enable remote-access
3. If you change the port and address when prompted for the address of the Jellyfin Server, you can also reverse proxy other services, however additional configuration will be required and I will not be able to help you in Troubleshooting
